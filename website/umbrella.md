This issue will keep track of the current progress of v8.

## v8 Goals

react-day-picker v8 is a complete rewrite.

The current architecture is becoming cluttered and obsolete and it's no more fun to maintain.

The main objectives of the new major release are:

- remove internal date utilities and make [date-fns](http://date-fns.org) a peer dependency
- simplify the source code
- have consistent, modern API updated for latest React
- have better and more consistent support of "custom components"
- move from webpack to rollup for the build process
- get rid of `DayPickerInput`
- have a new website built with Docusaurus
