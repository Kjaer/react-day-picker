---

Use the [DayPicker props](./props) to make the calendar interactive and customize its appearance and behavior.

To familiarize with DayPicker, this page describes how to implement some basic date picker features.

## Setting the initial month

Use [`initialMonth`](./props#initialmonth) to set the first month.

DayPicker will work as stateful component holding the current month in state. Use [`onMonthChange`](./props#onmonthchange) to know when the user navigate between months.

```jsx preview
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { DayPicker } from 'react-day-picker';

function App() {
  return (
    <DayPicker
      initialMonth={new Date(2019, 8)}
      onMonthChange={day => console.log(day.toLocaleDateString())}
    />
  );
}
```

### Controlled Component

If want to use DayPicker as **controlled component**:

- use `month` to pass the current month
- use `onMonthChange` to update the current month

Note: when in controlled mode, without `onMonthChange` the navigation element is not visible.

```jsx preview
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { DayPicker } from 'react-day-picker';

function App() {
  const [month, setMonth] = useState(new Date());
  return <DayPicker month={month} onMonthChange={month => setMonth(month)} />;
}
```

## Selecting Days

#### To select a day from the calendar

1. listen to the [`onDayClick`](./props#ondayclick) event to get the clicked day;
2. save the clicked day in your componentâ€™s state;
3. highlight the selected day using the [`selected`](./props#selected) prop.

```jsx preview
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { DayPicker } from 'react-day-picker';

function App() {
  const [selectedDay, setSelectedDay] = useState();
  const handleDayClick = day => setSelectedDay(day);
  return (
    <div>
      <DayPicker selected={selectedDay} onDayClick={handleDayClick} />
      {selectedDay && <span>Selected: {selectedDay.toLocaleDateString()}</span>}
      {!selectedDay && <em>Please select a day.</em>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### To select multiple days

1. initialize the state with an empty array;
2. add the day to the array when a day is clicked;
3. check if the day is already selected to unselect it.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { DayPicker } from 'react-day-picker';
import { isSameDay } from 'date-fns';

function App() {
  const [selectedDays, setSelectedDays] = useState([]);

  const handleDayClick = day =>
    setSelectedDays(currentDays => {
      const selectedIndex = currentDays.findIndex(d => isSameDay(d, day));
      if (selectedIndex > -1) {
        // Remove the day from the selected ones
        const newDays = [...currentDays];
        newDays.splice(selectedIndex, 1);
        return newDays;
      }
      return [...currentDays, day];
    });

  const nOfDays = selectedDays.length;
  return (
    <div>
      <DayPicker selected={selectedDays} onDayClick={handleDayClick} />
      {nOfDays > 0 && <span>{nOfDays} day(s) selected</span>}
      {nOfDays === 0 && <i>Select some days</i>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Disabling or Hiding Days

Similarly to `selected`, the `hidden` and `disabled` props can be used to hide or disable the day cell. These props too support [few useful types](./matching-days).

For example, the following DayPicker shows a calendar where Tuesdays are disabled and few days are hidden.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { DayPicker } from 'react-day-picker';

function App() {
  const [selectedDay, setSelectedDay] = useState([]);
  const isTuesday = day => day.getDay() === 2;
  const hiddenDays = [
    new Date(2019, 8, 26),
    new Date(2019, 8, 27),
    new Date(2019, 8, 28),
  ];
  return (
    <DayPicker
      month={new Date(2019, 8)}
      selected={selectedDay}
      hidden={hiddenDays}
      disabled={isTuesday}
      onDayClick={day => setSelectedDay(day)}
    />
  );
}
```
