TODO: _DayPicker is a date picker and calendar component for React. Thanks to its minimal and extensible design, it works great for many use cases!_

#### Installing DayPicker

1. Add [`date-fns`](https://date-fns.org/) and `react-day-picker` to the project’s dependencies:

```bash
# when using yarn
yarn add date-fns react-day-picker

# when using npm
npm install date-fns react-day-picker
```

2. import `DayPicker` in your script:

```jsx preview
import { DayPicker } from "react-day-picker";

function App() {
  return <DayPicker />;
}
```

Without any props, DayPicker renders the today’s monthly calendar. See [Using DayPicker](./basics) to learn how to add features to the component. You may want also to give a look to the [DayPicker props](./props).
